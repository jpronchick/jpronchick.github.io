<p>I am a graduating linguistics and computer science student at Bucknell University seeking a Ph.D. in computational linguistics.</p>
<p>I take a human-centered approach to help data workers <strong>evaluate and communicate uncertainty and statistics</strong> with visualizations. My thesis was about integrating visualization grammars with data analysts&rsquo; task language. Through my internships at two national labs, I have <strong>applied</strong> my research interests to challenges I care about &mdash; climate change and renewable energy. I am also interested in adopting and improving <strong>open science</strong> practices.</p>
<p>Across my projects, I have used a wide range of methods, such as <a href="/tags/design">design</a>, <a href="/tags/implementation">system-building</a>, participant <a href="/tags/experiment">experiments</a> &amp; (Bayesian) statistical <a href="/tags/analysis">analyses</a>, and qualitative <a href="/tags/interview">interviews</a>.</p>
